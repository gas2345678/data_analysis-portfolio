# DATA ANALYSIS
Greetings!
Here you will find some of my recent projects of data analysis made with libraries like pandas, numpy and seaborn.
*These projects are based on datasets of real data from the web.
Tools used: Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly
Some of the visualizations are made with seaborn, while the rest of them are made with
Plotly to bring a better customization to certain parameters. 
 # These datasets are available in kaggle.com
